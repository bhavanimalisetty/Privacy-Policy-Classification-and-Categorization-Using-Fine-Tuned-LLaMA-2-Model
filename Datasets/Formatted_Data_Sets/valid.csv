 External links are intended to support NARA's mission. They are not intended to support private or commercial organizations or businesses. Links to .org, .gov, .edu, .mil or other non-profit sites that share historical and documentary interests inherent to NARA's mission are encouraged because of their general non-commercial, public-interest nature. Links to .com, .net, and other commercial domains are acceptable if supportive of customers' needs and relevant to NARA's mission. NARA cannot support a volume or constant update of changing links that exceed the agency's resources for this maintenance. In cases where NARA links to external web portals, parties that wish to be included among the portal's links should contact the owner of the portal.
